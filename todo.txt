ability to select drawing subject matter
    - number, letters, doodles, combinations of each of these
        + different ML model for each combination (8 total if I do all)
        ? maybe also different methods of training model (fully connected + CNN, total 16 models needed)

fix model
    - as sebastian lague's video, randomly rotate,scale,transform, to increase accuracy.

continue cleaning/refactoring/code-splitting (saveImage function)

maybe revert to showing all predictions, if new model gives better values for it.

web worker throws out old event as soon as a new one comes in (not possible?)
    - when deployed, the web worker gets clogged a bit and over time sends back results with a large delay
