feed smallImage (28x28 array of 0-255 pixel values) into ML model
print actual results of model instead of test data
make responsive design
    - tricky with canvases, scaling doesn't work normally
        + library makes it even harder
    * maybe make 3 modes (small, medium, large)
        - if device width > 1500, use large settings
        - if device width > 800, use medium settings
        - else use small settings
        ? this could work, should be easier to implement than perfectly fitting screen size
ability to select drawing subject matter
    - number, letters, doodles, combinations of each of these
        + different ML model for each combination (8 total if I do all)
        ? maybe also different methods of training model (fully connected + CNN, total 16 models needed)
fix general styling
    - red with black cursor thing looks bad imo
