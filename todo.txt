ability to select drawing subject matter
    - number, letters, doodles, combinations of each of these
        + different ML model for each combination (8 total if I do all)
        ? maybe also different methods of training model (fully connected + CNN, total 16 models needed)
fix general styling
    - red with black cursor thing looks bad imo
fix model
    - as sebastian lague's video, randomly rotate,scale,transform, to increase accuracy.

continue cleaning/refactoring/code-splitting (saveImage function)

maybe revert to showing all predictions, if new model gives better values for it.

send message to web worker when it loads, so first time drawing doesn't cause the little bit of lag

find a way to access a mouse-move event on the react-canvas-draw component
    - will allow me to calculate the pixelated version of drawing in real-time, instead of on mouse-up
    - can make the react-canvas-draw component invisible and overlay with other one
        - drawing will appear pixelated directly from the beginning
    - additionally, model predictions will happen constantly, maybe better user experience
    ! doesn't really seem possible, maybe implement a simplified drawing component myself
        - shouldn't be too bad, many tutorials
        - I am using almost none of the cool features of react-canvas-draw
        - grid lines may be difficult, but unnecessary if I overlap the 2 canvases.
