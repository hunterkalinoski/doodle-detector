ability to select drawing subject matter
    - number, letters, doodles, combinations of each of these
        + different ML model for each combination (8 total if I do all)
        ? maybe also different methods of training model (fully connected + CNN, total 16 models needed)
fix general styling
    - red with black cursor thing looks bad imo
fix model
    - as sebastian lague's video, randomly rotate,scale,transform, to increase accuracy.
change output visualization
    - most outputs are like e-9 or something (very small compared to actualy output (ex. 99.9999% vs 0.0000000001%))
        so maybe only show the top prediction, not all possibilities.
fix styling on output visualization
    - if kept similar to how it is now, values get resized after changing for the first time, make this constant
show loading indicator while model is loading (don't let drawings attempt to go through)
show loading indicator on very first page startup (before canvas-draw's grid appears)
continue cleaning/refactoring/code-splitting

DONE: 
feed smallImage (28x28 array of 0-255 pixel values) into ML model

print actual results of model instead of test data

cleaned jsx/css/some of the code

make responsive design
    - tricky with canvases, scaling doesn't work normally
        + library makes it even harder
    * maybe make 3 modes (small, medium, large)
        - if device width > 1500, use large settings
        - if device width > 800, use medium settings
        - else use small settings
        ? this could work, should be easier to implement than perfectly fitting screen size
    (alt)
        - simply make it so left-half of drawing canvas doesn't get cut off (idk why it happens)
        - if you just have to scroll around, thats probably okay too. (or atleast an improvement)
    [what was completed]: (alt)
        - sections are all constant size now, not cut off on left ever
        - middle section no longer resizes after page fully loads.
        - mobile views the sections vertically rather than horizontally.
